Tis the Season to be… a community. While for many the feeling of community is tied to the holidays, older adult centers like Encore Community Services gives back to the community all year round.

“A big part of our mission is just empowering our seniors,” according to Marcus Jackson the Social Case Worker at the groups Lifelong Learning Center. A goal achieved through various initiatives that leave their clientele feeling “like they are independent, can make their own decisions, they can have fun, and do whatever they want.”

That mission may be in jeopardy since older adult centers amongst other programs are expected to experience setbacks due to budget cuts detailed in the Department for the Aging executive plan for 2024. Amongst other things the plans details $17.9 million cut to the budgets for Senior Centers and meals from 2023. However, $7 million of the cut is coming from Older Adult Centers partially because less usage of the centers and their budgets than originally estimated

A closer look into this branch located at 755 Tenth Avenue – which is one of four locations located in Midtown Manhattan – where, as the name suggest, is a place members of the community come to learn and seek services through the educational and social work programs offered shows what community these cuts may affect. </p>

“The Lifelong Learning Center has a diverse demographic of clients from racial backgrounds although the clientele are normally 60 years old and up since that is what is qualified as a senior.

“We have a Rolodex of people that we work with,” said Cris Corprew, the Adult Learning Coordinator. “I get the consultants and the instructors in here – pharmacies for the for the blood pressure screening. The Metropolitan Museum we took a trip there and they also send us our art, utensils and stuff like that for different, and we reached out to university, and we found the ESL (English second language) teacher.”

Looking ahead to the new year and the expansion of the program Corprew, whose joined the center earlier this year said his main goal “is to continue building community in here. We want to bring in the things that they need, but mainly to build a community here.”
